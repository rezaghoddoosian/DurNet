## Action Duration Prediction for Segment-Level Alignment of Weakly-Labeled Videos

This is the code for our WACV 2021 accepted paper :
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.10190.pdf

Here we describe the content of the folder:

### Alignment_with_TCFPN_PseudoGroundTruth_on_BreakfastDataset: 
This folder contains all the neccessary codes and files to reproduce the results for our model using the TCFPN pseudo ground-truth on the breakfast dataset (Table 1 of the paper). The ReadMe file inside this folder provides further instructions to produce the results of our ablation study too. 
	
	-action2verb.txt: specifies the action indices for each of the defined verbs. 
	-action2object.txt: specifies the corresponding main object of each main action. It also lists the indices for all objects.
